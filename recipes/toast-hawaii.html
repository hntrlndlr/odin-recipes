    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a very common lunch in Germany but I guss it's more unpopular in other parts of the world. Quite reasonable I guess. But if you taste it it's awesome. I also have a very special personal relationship to that dish. My father mostly cooked for my brother and me on tuesdays, the other days he was off working. Turns out, my father ain't that creative as a cook! But very passionate about the four dishes he optimized. Just like this one here: Toast Hawaii! Instead of preparing it with ham like most others would do my father used tuna which is a great combination in my opinion. Even nowadays I enjoy the combination of pineapple and tuna. Here's how you prepare it… </p>
