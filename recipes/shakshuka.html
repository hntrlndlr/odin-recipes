    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>One of my all-time first-date dishes. Orginally, breakfast in middle east, especially famous in Israel! As well as in Berlin for now… But it's great. Taste it and you'll have to admit that it's one of the most decadent breakfasts you ever had! I often prepare it for dinner. Serve with bread and enjoy your guests' overwhelmed gaze! </p>
