    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>One of my favorite dishes. I just prepared it. It's super easy to prepare. And the burrata just makes it so creamy! Yummy! Online you'll find some recipes also containing milk, cream or any other dairy product. But if you use good-quality burrata you won't need any more cream - prepare for some cheese-based creamynessâ€¦</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Pasta</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>200 grams pasta (your choice); I recommend using some thicker pasta</li>
        <li>Water as declared in the preparation for the pasta</li>
        <li>Salt - use an amount of salt so you won't need salt in the sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Sauce</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 red onion; cubed</li>
        <li>1 clove of garlic; thinly sliced</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pepper; moderately cubed</li>
        <li>4 mushrooms (champignons); quartered</li>
        <li>500 grams of dashed tomato (one can)</li>
        <li>Grinded black pepper</li>
        <li><em>Last but not leasted:</em> 1 ball of burrata</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>

        <li>Put the olive oil to moderate heat in a large pan</li>

        <li>Enjoy!</li>
